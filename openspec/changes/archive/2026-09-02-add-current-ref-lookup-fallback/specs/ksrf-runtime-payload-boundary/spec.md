## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Validator distinguishes source and runtime assurance

The portable validator MUST provide explicit `source` and `runtime` profiles. The `source` profile MUST validate behavioral and trigger evals, security-scan all source-only assets, invoke the canonical public-source artifact contract, and remain the default. The `runtime` profile MAY skip only eval-specific checks, MUST reject any remaining source-only `tests/`, `evals/`, versioned maintainer specifications, or exact maintainer-file artifact, and MUST preserve all other package, content, link, metadata, security, and cross-contract checks. Every report MUST identify the profile, coverage, source-release eligibility, and a deterministic identity for the runtime-eligible bytes observed. A runtime report MUST NOT expose a `publish_manifest`, and runtime CLI invocation MUST reject standalone manifest output.

Runtime freshness lookup MUST be disabled by default. An explicit runtime-only update check MUST first resolve canonical GitHub `main` through the fixed GitHub REST ref endpoint. Only when that ref request fails with bounded reason `network_error`, the validator MUST attempt exactly once to use a non-interactive, time- and output-bounded Git subprocess when an absolute Git executable is available through the fixed system search; an absent or unusable executable MUST yield `unknown/network_error`. The subprocess MUST use the fixed canonical HTTPS repository, exact `refs/heads/main`, isolated process environment and configuration, disabled repository discovery, and no shell. The fallback MUST accept exactly one byte-canonical lowercase 40-hex commit record for that exact ref; it MUST NOT run after an invalid, redirected, oversized, or otherwise hostile REST response or after any immutable-manifest failure. The validator MUST fetch the manifest at the one resolved immutable commit and report `current`, `different`, or `unknown` without writing files. By default freshness MUST NOT change validation exit semantics. The additive current-required mode MUST be accepted only with a complete runtime update check and, after validation/strict failure precedence, MUST return `0` for `current`, `10` for `different`, and `20` for `unknown`. Candidate `current` MUST be confirmed by a second local runtime identity pass after the network lookup and by stable device/inode/type/resolved-path identity of the lexical runtime root; a changed tree or root MUST fail validation and MUST NOT retain `current`. Current-required mode MUST reject file report output before validation/network so its final target observation is not invalidated by its own write. JSON shape on stdout MUST remain unchanged, while current-required human output MUST name the overall outcome without a false-green heading. The validator MUST NOT call unequal content definitely outdated, MUST NOT turn unavailable coverage into a current result, and MUST NOT represent runtime or freshness validation as source-release, publication, legal, or filing authority.

#### Scenario: Default runtime validation is offline

- **WHEN** runtime validation is invoked without an update-check option
- **THEN** no network opener or Git subprocess is called, the report includes the local runtime identity, and freshness is `not_checked`

#### Scenario: Runtime identity is emitted

- **WHEN** all runtime-eligible files remain stable while validation hashes them
- **THEN** the report exposes the same aggregate tree SHA-256, file count, and byte count as the canonical release manifest algorithm, while `publish_manifest` remains null

#### Scenario: Runtime file changes between manifest and identity passes

- **WHEN** a runtime file becomes unreadable or its size or digest changes before aggregate identity is finalized
- **THEN** validation records a bounded error, emits no passing local identity, and any requested freshness result is `unknown`

#### Scenario: Installed content equals current main

- **WHEN** explicit runtime update checking resolves one valid canonical `main` commit, the pinned manifest tree hash equals the local runtime tree hash, and the post-network local pass confirms the same identity
- **THEN** freshness is `current`, reports the compared remote SHA and hashes, and explains byte equivalence without claiming installation provenance

#### Scenario: REST network failure uses the fixed Git fallback

- **WHEN** the REST ref lookup fails with bounded `network_error` and the hardened Git command returns exactly one lowercase 40-hex SHA for `refs/heads/main`
- **THEN** the validator fetches the manifest only at that immutable SHA and completes the existing current-or-different comparison

#### Scenario: Git fallback output is ambiguous or malformed

- **WHEN** the fallback is absent, times out, exits nonzero, is signaled, exceeds its output cap, or emits anything other than one byte-canonical record for the exact ref
- **THEN** freshness is `unknown` with bounded `network_error`, `invalid_response`, or `response_too_large` according to the failure class, no Git diagnostic is exposed, and no manifest request is made

#### Scenario: Hostile REST evidence cannot trigger fallback

- **WHEN** the REST ref response is redirected, oversized, malformed, schema-invalid, or otherwise classified as `invalid_response` or `response_too_large`
- **THEN** no Git subprocess is invoked and freshness remains `unknown` with the original bounded reason

#### Scenario: Immutable manifest failure cannot trigger fallback

- **WHEN** REST ref resolution succeeds but the manifest request at that SHA fails or returns invalid evidence
- **THEN** no Git subprocess is invoked and freshness remains `unknown`

#### Scenario: Installed content changes during online comparison

- **WHEN** the local runtime identity differs between the pre-network and post-network passes
- **THEN** validation records `RUNTIME_IDENTITY_CHANGED`, freshness is `unknown`, and current-required mode returns validation failure rather than `0`

#### Scenario: Runtime root is rebound during online comparison

- **WHEN** the lexical runtime root no longer resolves to the initially observed regular directory identity
- **THEN** validation records `RUNTIME_ROOT_CHANGED`, freshness is `unknown`, and current-required mode returns validation failure rather than `0`

#### Scenario: Installed content differs from current main

- **WHEN** both local and pinned remote identities are valid but unequal
- **THEN** freshness is `different` and explains that the local tree may be older, customized, or locally modified

#### Scenario: Freshness evidence is unavailable

- **WHEN** both permitted ref-resolution routes are unavailable, a permitted remote operation exceeds its bound, a permitted response fails strict validation, or local identity is unavailable
- **THEN** freshness is `unknown` with a bounded reason code and the report does not claim current content

#### Scenario: Branch moves after ref resolution

- **WHEN** canonical `main` advances after its SHA was resolved by either permitted route
- **THEN** the comparison uses the manifest fetched by the already resolved immutable SHA rather than refetching by branch name

#### Scenario: Source caller requests online freshness

- **WHEN** `--check-updates` is combined with the source profile
- **THEN** CLI rejects the combination as a usage error before network or subprocess access

#### Scenario: Partial runtime caller requests online freshness

- **WHEN** `--check-updates` is combined with a package selection smaller than the canonical 15-package runtime
- **THEN** CLI rejects the combination before network or subprocess access because the partial local tree is not comparable with the canonical remote manifest

#### Scenario: Current-required mode lacks complete update scope

- **WHEN** `--require-current` is used without `--check-updates`, the runtime profile, or the complete canonical package set
- **THEN** CLI returns usage code `2` before validation, network, or subprocess access

#### Scenario: Current-required mode requests report file output

- **WHEN** `--require-current` is combined with `--report-out`
- **THEN** CLI returns usage code `2` before validation, network access, subprocess access, or any report-file write

#### Scenario: Current-required outcomes

- **WHEN** complete runtime validation passes and current-required freshness is respectively `current`, `different`, or `unknown`
- **THEN** the process returns respectively `0`, `10`, or `20`, while calls without current-required mode retain prior validation exit behavior

#### Scenario: Freshness result is rendered

- **WHEN** runtime validation emits human or JSON output
- **THEN** JSON keeps its bounded stable fields, current-required human output names the effective validation/freshness outcome, and runtime/source-release boundaries remain explicit
